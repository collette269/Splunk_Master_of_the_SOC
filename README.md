<table signature signature_id | dedup signature>

2.	A report that provides the count and percent of the severity.
<Top severity>

3.	A report that provides a comparison between the success and failure of Windows activities.
<Stats count by status>

ALERTS:

BASELINE over 25

DASHBOARDS: 
1.	A line chart that displays the different signature field values over time.

2.	A line chart that displays the different user field values over time.
<timechart count by user>

3.	A pie chart that illustrates the count of different signatures.
<top signature>

4.	A pie chart that illustrates the count of different users.
<top user>

5.	A statistical chart that illustrates the count of different users.
<top user>
