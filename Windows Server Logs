Windows Server Logs

Load logs into Splunk. Analyze data. Develop baseline. Create reports, alerts and dashboards.

REPORTS:
1.	A report with a table of signatures and associated SignatureID. 
<table signature signature_id | dedup signature>

2.	A report that provides the count and percent of the severity.
<Top severity>

3.	A report that provides a comparison between the success and failure of Windows activities.
<Stats count by status>

ALERTS:
1.	Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly level of failed Windows activity.
<Status=failure>
BASELINE over 8   

2.	Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly count of the signature: an account was successfully logged on.   
<Signature=”An account was successfully logged on”>
BASELINE over 45

3.	Determine a baseline and threshold for hourly count of the signature: a user account was deleted. 
<Signature-“a user account was deleted”>
BASELINE over 25

DASHBOARDS: 
1.	A line chart that displays the different signature field values over time.
<timechart span=1h count by signature>

2.	A line chart that displays the different user field values over time.
<timechart count by user>

3.	A pie chart that illustrates the count of different signatures.
<top signature>

4.	A pie chart that illustrates the count of different users.
<top user>

5.	A statistical chart that illustrates the count of different users.
<top user>

6.	A radial gauge that illustrates total level of activity
<stats count as total>
